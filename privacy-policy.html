    <h1>Privacy Policy for WiFi Ghost</h1>

    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated: October 2, 2024</strong></p>

    <p>
      At <strong>WiFi Ghost</strong> ("we", "us", or "our"), your privacy is our
      top priority. This Privacy Policy explains how our macOS application
      <strong>WiFi Ghost</strong> operates, emphasizing that we do not collect
      any personal data. Any information accessed by the app is used solely to
      display real-time WiFi information within the app window.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Access</h2>

    <h3>Location Data</h3>

    <p>
      WiFi Ghost may request access to your device's location services to
      display the WiFi network name (<strong>SSID</strong>). Due to macOS
      privacy policies, accessing the SSID requires location services to be
      enabled. This location data is used exclusively within the app to retrieve
      and display the SSID in real-time. We do not collect, store, or transmit
      your location data off your device.
    </p>

    <h3>WiFi Network Information</h3>

    <p>
      WiFi Ghost accesses the following WiFi network information available on
      your device:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Signal Strength Percentage</strong></li>
      <li><strong>WiFi Band</strong> (e.g., 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz)</li>
      <li><strong>Channel Number</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This information is used solely to display real-time WiFi network details
      within the app window. We do not collect, store, or transmit this
      information off your device.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>

    <p>
      All information accessed by WiFi Ghost is used exclusively to provide
      real-time WiFi network details within the app window. The app processes
      this information locally on your device, ensuring that your data remains
      private and secure.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Collection, Sharing, and Disclosure</h2>

    <p>
      WiFi Ghost does <strong>not</strong> collect any personal or non-personal
      data from your device. We do not store any data, nor do we transmit any
      data off your device. All information accessed by the app is used solely
      for the purpose of displaying real-time WiFi information within the app
      window. We do not share any information with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <p>
      Since WiFi Ghost does not collect or store any data, there is no data to
      secure or protect from unauthorized access. All processing occurs locally
      on your device, and the app relies on macOS's built-in security features
      to operate.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>
      WiFi Ghost does not use or integrate with any third-party services. The app operates independently
      without any external data connections.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      WiFi Ghost does not collect any personal information from users of any
      age, including children under the age of 13. The app is designed to
      function without collecting or storing any user data, ensuring privacy for
      all users.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
      posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to
      review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
    </p>
