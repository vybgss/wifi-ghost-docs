    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>1. How do I enable location services for WiFi Ghost?</strong
        ><br />
        To access SSID information, WiFi Ghost requires location services to be
        enabled. You can do this by going to
        <strong>System Settings > Privacy & Security > Privacy</strong>,
        selecting <strong>Location Services</strong>, and enabling it for WiFi
        Ghost.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>2. Why can't I see my WiFi network name (SSID)?</strong><br />
        If location services are turned off, WiFi Ghost won't be able to show
        the SSID. Ensure that location services are enabled in your system's
        privacy settings.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>3. Can I customize the refresh rate for WiFi data?</strong

        settings. You can choose the interval that works best for your needs.
      </li>
